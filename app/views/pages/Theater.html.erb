<p>Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see? 
<br>Do you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe it. 
<br>Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going into work? A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes <br>belly up. Disappears! It ceases to exist without me. 
<br>No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. 
<br>I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? 
<br>No. I am the one who knocks!
